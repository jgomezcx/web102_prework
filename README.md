## Notes

I had a couple of challeneges while building this interactive web-application. One of the first challenges I had was working with backend JS and really working towards Building the functionality to work with the data hardcoded into JS. The calling of the data wasn't the hard part, but building functionality based on that data was challenging but fun. Another challenge I had was building a way to find both the top funded and unfunded sections as this required to add functionality that can be changed based on buttons implemented in html those functions would then change what was displayed in JS on the live server. Overall this Web app was really fun to work on!
